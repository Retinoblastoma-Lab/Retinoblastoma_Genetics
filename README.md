# Retinoblastoma_Genetics
This repository contains Data, Code, and Results of the Kenyan RB1 variant calling analysis among 70 children with biallelic retinoblastoma.  


The README file has a detailed analysis plan, detailing each step of the analysis pipeline.    

This Repository has two parts:  
    a. Analysis Steps to identify inDELS (Insertions and Deletions), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism.  
    b. Analysis Steps to identify Copy Number Variations (CNVs)  


### Part 1: SNPS and Indels Analysis



### Part 2: Copy Number Variation Analysis  
This a step-by-step guide for using [CNVkit](https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to identify copy number variations (CNVs) in the Kenyan Retinoblastoma targeted RB1 gene sequencing, including the necessary code at each step. CNVkit is optimized for targeted sequencing panels, exomes, and WGS  

#### Step 0: Setup
Install CNVkit  
**Note**: Make sure you have a working Python environment (Python â‰¥ 3.6). Then install CNVkit:
