# Retinoblastoma_Genetics
Retinoblastoma is a rare, malignant intraocular tumor that primarily affects children under the age of five. It arises from the retinal neuroblastic cells and is most commonly associated with biallelic inactivation of the *RB1* tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 13q14.     
The disease can present unilaterally or bilaterally, with the hereditary form often exhibiting bilateral and multifocal involvement. Clinical manifestations include leukocoria, strabismus, and impaired vision.  
Early detection is critical, as delayed diagnosis can lead to extraocular extension  and metastasis. Therapeutic approaches include enucleation, chemotherapy, focal therapies, and, in select cases, radiation. Prognosis is favorable with prompt and appropriate intervention.
